“No need to hurry. No need to sparkle. No need to be anybody but oneself.”
“We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.”
“My wish for you is that you continue. Continue to be who you are, to astonish a mean world with your acts of kindness.”
“Life has no limitations, except the ones you make.”
