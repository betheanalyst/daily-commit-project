“It is never too late to be what you might have been.” 
“Next time, ask ‘What’s the worst that will happen?’ Then push yourself a little further than you dare.”
“I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be.”
“Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later.”
