“Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.”
“If you don’t like the road you’re walking, start paving another one.”
“Life has no limitations, except the ones you make.”
“There is no passion to be found playing small—in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living.”
