“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” 
“Keep your face towards the sunshine and shadows will fall behind you.” 
“Before anything else, preparation is the key to success.”
“The new dawn blooms as we free it. For there is always light if only we’re brave enough to see it, if only we’re brave enough to be it.”
