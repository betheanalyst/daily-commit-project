“If you can do what you do best and be happy, you are further along in life than most people.” 
“Don’t take yourself too seriously. Know when to laugh at yourself, and find a way to laugh at obstacles that inevitably present themselves.”
“Don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.”
