“Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later.”
“The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.” 
“If you live long enough, you’ll make mistakes. But if you learn from them, you’ll be a better person.”
“Tomorrow is a new day. You shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense.”
